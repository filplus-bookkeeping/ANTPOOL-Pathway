This particular dataset is from the Epoch of Reionization project to detect signatures of the first stars and galaxies forming and the effect of these early stars and galaxies on the evolution of the universe, a key science driver of the SKA. Nearly 2PB of such observations have been recorded to date, this is is a small subset of that which has been exported from the MWA data archive in Perth.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
